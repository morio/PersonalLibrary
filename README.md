# The open source Personal Library Project
The purpose behind this is to automate all the ‘things’ needed to run a personal library from home.

## The 'things':
The sending and returning of items.
Replacement of items if they get damaged.
Making it easy for lost items to be returned 
(A label with a QR code that send the finder a box to ship the item back and possible a monetary reward once it is returned)

That should be enough to an idea of what I want it to do.
## Personal Reason for Starting This:
I have a lot of old college textbooks that I spent $$$boku$$$ cash on.
I still have my books from growing up, like the Peanut comic collections that the Snoopy Ice Arena would give me every time I held a birthday there.

I also have old PS1 and PS3 games that are gathering dust.
And a PS3 that can play PS1 and PS2 games.

I'd love to able to lends these to people I know, but it would be too much to keep track of everything.

So that is the problem.

This project is the solution.

## A bit about me:
I spent about 4 years at O'Reilly Media Inc doing almost every aspect of web development.
From ETLs, to writing one off Ruby scripts to upload their entire catalog to AWS and then verify it was correct.

I didn't study web development in college. I learned how to translate my neighbor's parent’s computing framework (for hotel reservations systems before there was an internet) company’s help files from their internal markup to HTML before Netscape hit version 4. And I did all by myself with minimal help learning the language (a variant of BASIC).

I am 35 now, so I was young then.

I didn't study web development in college and for me it is, honestly, boring.

I graduated in 2011 with a BS degree in Computer Engineering.
It took me 11 years to get (normally 4... well 5 if you ask the students)

My original goal was to get a MS in 5 years and then go on to a PhD.

Medical reasons stopped my progress and I have finally realized the only thing really stopping me from my dreams was myself and my self-doubt.

So this is to keep my webdev kung fu fresh while I pursue a PhD in Quantum Computer Engineering.
If it doesn't exist I'll start one.
(My grandfather was the head of the English Department at a University)

So come join in the fun. 
This project will always try to adopt the latest greatest, even if the whole project has to be rewritten (New branch :P).

And hey just say hi if you want to hear some fun stories about my life :D

See you next time Space Cowboy…
